## 📝 Decision Log

### Decision: Drizzle ORM instead of TypeORM
- **Date:** Phase 2
- **Rationale:** Better type safety, smaller bundle, better TS support
- **Impact:** ✅ Zero runtime errors in ORM, type-safe queries

### Decision: Settings as separate mega-feature
- **Date:** Feb 4, 2026
- **Rationale:** Reduces cognitive load, allows parallel UI development
- **Impact:** ✅ Can work on Alerts/Docs/Warnings in parallel

### Decision: Predictive warnings without ML yet
- **Date:** Feb 4, 2026
- **Rationale:** Time series analysis sufficient for MVP, ML in Phase 5
- **Impact:** ✅ Faster delivery, same value

### Decision: PostgreSQL over MongoDB
- **Date:** Phase 1
- **Rationale:** ACID compliance, relationships, better for multi-tenant
- **Impact:** ✅ Zero data integrity issues, excellent performance
